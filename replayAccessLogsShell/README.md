:::Access Replay Acces Log Shell Based:::

Replays the URLs in the access log sending traffic to the server thats specified in the command line.
Note the access log assumes all URLs to be HTTP method:GET even if its a POST or anything else.

Syntax:
./accesLogReplay.sh <publisher or dispatcher access log> <path to where the log and the results should be output> <URL prefix>  <[uniq | all]>
 
Example: (Will sort the access log paths, make them unique and they try accessing each url)
./accesLogReplay.sh /projects/customer/access.log /projects/customer/log http://localhost:4503 uniq
 
Example: (Will replay access log after sorting them)
./accesLogReplay.sh /projects/customer/access.log /projects/customer/log http://localhost:4503 all
 
The output will be sent to results.csv file (for my example above):
/projects/customer/log/results.<timestamp>.csv
